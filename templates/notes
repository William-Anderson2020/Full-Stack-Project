What I want to do kind of?????????????

-> Like organize the text box/ party box into a template?
And like plug factors (text, colors) in depending on the character??
That's kinda basic javascript though....

-> Personalized quotes (also javascript) if one character is verus another?

"I'm Ephraim. Now, how about we cut this short and get to sparring? It's a better way to get to know each other."
"Trust me, I don't pick fights I can't win."
